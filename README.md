# Implementationofaprocessor, a ComputerEngineeringProject -(PEC_Soc)

* Development of a simple unicycle processor RISC, shaped by two blocks (Bank of Registers and ALU) and a small control logic.
* Wiring of all connections for inputs/ouputs devices, implementation of advanced systems and structures, support of interruptions and exceptions and basic support for existing operating systems. Project developed with VHDL.
